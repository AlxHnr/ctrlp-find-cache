===============================================================================
1. Description                                     *ctrlp-find-cache-description*

This plugin provides asynchronous caching for ctrlp. It spawns find as a
background process to cache its output for subsequent runs. Thus you can only
search trough files, which already existed at the time of the previous search.

This plugin depends on ctrlp, bash, and various commands from coreutils.
Almost all GNU/Linux distributions have them preinstalled already.

2. Options                                             *ctrlp-find-cache-options*

By default this plugin works out of the box. If you have not set
|'g:ctrlp_user_command'|, it will be set to the concatenation of
|g:ctrlp_find_cache#command|, the string ' %s ' and the variable
|g:ctrlp_find_cache#arguments|.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Path to find cache command                       *g:ctrlp_find_cache#command*

The variable |g:ctrlp_find_cache#command| contains the full path to the
find-cache shell script, which provides the core functionality of this plugin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Additional arguments for find                  *g:ctrlp_find_cache#arguments*

The variable |g:ctrlp_find_cache#arguments| contains extra arguments, which
will be passed to find. By default it contains various flags, which are needed
to skip VCS directories, cache directories, build files and various file
formats which Vim can't open.

Default:
>
  let g:ctrlp_find_cache#arguments =
    \ "-type f -regextype posix-extended -not -regex"
    \ . " '^(.*\/)?(\\.(cache|fontconfig|thumbnails|git)|build|CMakeFiles)(\/.*)?'"
    \ . " -not -iregex '^.*\\.(o|a|so|exe|dll|bin|pyc|gz|xz|bz2|zip|rar|pdf"
    \ . "|png|jpe?g|ico|gif|xpm|bak)$'"
    \ . " -not -regex '^.*[a-f]\d[a-f0-9]{10,}.*$'"
<
Changing this variable after this plugin was loaded won't have any effect. For
this you must update |'g:ctrlp_user_command'| manually.
